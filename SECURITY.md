## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is a top priority for StackForge, and we appreciate your efforts to disclose security vulnerabilities responsibly. If you identify a vulnerability, please follow the reporting guidelines below:

1. **Contact Us**: Report vulnerabilities via email to [hamdankhubaib959@gmail.com](mailto:hamdankhubaib959@gmail.com).
2. **Provide Details**: Include a description of the vulnerability, the impact, and steps to reproduce it. If applicable, include the affected versions.
3. **Non-Disclosure**: We request that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed.

We will aim to respond within 3-5 business days and work towards a resolution within 10-15 days. Critical issues may be prioritized for faster resolution.

## Security Guidelines for Contributors

When contributing to StackForge, please keep these security guidelines in mind:

1. **Handle Sensitive Data Carefully**: Avoid hardcoding sensitive data, including API keys and tokens, and rely on environment variables instead.
2. **Sanitize Inputs**: When adding features, ensure user inputs are sanitized to prevent injections.
3. **Limit Dependencies**: Minimize dependencies, and avoid libraries with known vulnerabilities.
